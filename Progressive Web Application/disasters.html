        <h1>Types of Natural Disasters That Strike Within the Baguio-La Trinidad Area</h1>
        <p>The types of natural disasters which usually strike or occur in Baguio City and the province of Benguet are described on this page in detail.</p>

        <h2>Tropical Cyclone (Typhoon)</h2>
        <img src="images/tropicalCyclone.jpg">
        <p id="disasterssectiondesc">A tropical cyclone or typhoon is described as a rotating, organized system of clouds and thunderstorms. They form near the surface of a body of water when warm air rises, creating an area of low pressure. The movement of the rising warm air and surrounding air begins to rotate and continues to grow as the storm moves over the water. Once the spinning winds reach a high enough speed, it is categorized as a tropical storm.</p>
        <p id="disasterssectiondesc">These tropical storms originate over tropical or subtropical waters such as the Pacific Ocean or the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
        <h3>Tropical Cyclones or Typhoons are categorized in the Philippines into five different classes:</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Tropical Depression</dt>
                <dd>41 km/h to 62 km/h</dd>
            <dt>Tropical Storm</dt>
                <dd>63 km/h to 87 km/h</dd>
            <dt>Severe Tropical Storm</dt>
                <dd>88 km/h to 117 km/h</dd>
            <dt>Typhoon</dt>
                <dd>118 km/h to 149 km/h</dd>
            <dt>Severe Typhoon</dt>
                <dd>150 km/h to 184 km/h</dd>
            <dt>Super Typhoon</dt>
                <dd>185 km/h or above</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>The image below shows the storm signal warning categories:</p>
        <img id="stormSignalImg" src="images/PAGASAstormWarningSystem.png">
        <h3>Typhoon Hazards and Dangers</h3>
        <p>The dangers and risks which can be encountered are described below:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Storm Surge</dt>
            <dd>Abnormal rise of water near the coast which can reach heights of over 20 feet due to strong winds.</dd>
            <dt>Storm Tide</dt>
            <dd>Rise of water level due to the combination of the storm surge and the astronomical tide.</dd>
            <dt>Heavy Rainfall and Inland Flooding</dt>
            <dd>Flooding is a major threat to people living inland. Flash flooding which is the rapid rise of water levels can occur quickly due to the intense rainfall. Longer term flooding on rivers and streams can persist for serveral days after the storm. Slower moving and larger storms produce more rainfall. In addition, mountainous terrain enhances rainfall from a tropical storm.</dd>
            <dt>High Winds</dt>
            <dd>Tropical storm winds are strong enough to be dangerous to those caught in them. Typhoons with winds of 120 km/h or more can destroy buildings and other structures. Debris, such as signs, roofing material, or pieces of metal become flying missles during typhoons.</dd>

        <h2>Earthquake</h2>
        <img src="images/earthquake.jpg">
        <p id="disasterssectiondesc">An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earth's surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter.</p>
        <p id="disasterssectiondesc">Sometimes and earthquake has foreshocks. These are smaller earthquakes that happen in the same place as the larger earthquake that follows. Scientists can't tell that an earthquake is a foreshock until the larger earthquake happens. The largest, main earthquake is called the mainshock. Mainshocks always have aftershocks that follow which are smaller earthquakes that occur afterwards in the same place as the mainshock. Depending on the size of the Mainshock, aftershocks can continue for weeks, months, and even years.</p>
        <p id="disasterssectiondesc">Earthquakes are measured in magnitude by most scientists through the use of a seismograph and the Richter Scale.</p>
        <h3>The Earthquake Magnitude Scale</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Magnitude 2.5 or Less</dt>
            <dd>Usually not felt, but can be recorded by seismograph.</dd>
            <dt>Magnitude 2.6 to 5.4</dt>
            <dd>Often felt, but only causes minor damage.</dd>
            <dt>Magnitude 5.5 to 6.0</dt>
            <dd>Slight damage to buildings and other structures.</dd>
            <dt>Magnitude 6.1 to 6.9</dt>
            <dd>May cause a lot of damage in highly populated areas.</dd>
            <dt>Magnitude 7.0 to 7.9</dt>
            <dd>Major earthquake. Serious Damage.</dd>
            <dt>Magnitude 8.0 or greater</dt>
            <dd>Great earthquake. Can totally destroy communities near the epicenter.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h3>The Earthquake Magnitude Class</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Minor</dt>
            <dd>Magnitude 3 to 3.9</dd>
            <dt>Light</dt>
            <dd>Magnitude 4 to 4.9</dd>
            <dt>Moderate</dt>
            <dd>Magnitude 5 to 5.9</dd>
            <dt>Strong</dt>
            <dd>Magnitude 6 to 6.9</dd>
            <dt>Major</dt>
            <dd>Magnitude 7 to 7.9</dd>
            <dt>Great</dt>
            <dd>Magnitude 8 or greater</dd>
        </dl>
        <h3>Earthquake Hazards and Dangers</h3>
        <p>The dangers and risks which can be encountered are described below:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Ground Shaking</dt>
            <dd>Buildings can be damaged by the shaking itself or by the ground beneath them settling to a different level than it was before the earthquake. If an earthquake generates a large enough shaking intensity, structures like buildings, bridges and dams can be severely damaged, and cliffs and sloping ground destabilized. Perched or stacked objects may fall and injure or bury anyone close by.</dd>
            <dt>Ground Displacement</dt>
            <dd>One of the main hazards of an earthquake is ground movement along a fault. If a structure is built across a fault, the ground displacement during an earthquake could seriously damage or rip apart the structure.</dd>
            <dt>Landslides and Rockfalls</dt>
            <dd>Ground shaking due to earthquakes destabilises cliffs and steep slopes, causing landslides and rock falls as a significant side-effect.</dd>
            <dt>Flooding</dt>
            <dd>An earthquake can break dams or enbankments built to prevent the overflow of a river. The water from the river or reservoir would then flood the area, damaging buildings and maybe sweeping away or drowning people.</dd>
            <dt>Fire</dt>
            <dd>These fires can be started by broken gas lines and power lines, or tipped over wood or coal stoves.</dd>
            <dt>Liquefaction</dt>
            <dd>Also called earthquake liquefaction, it is ground failure or loss of strength that causes solid soil to behave temporarily as viscous liquid.</dd>

        <h2>Landslides</h2>
        <img src="images/landslide.jpg">
        <p id="disasterssectiondesc">A landslide is the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope. Debris and mud flows are rivers of rock, earth, and other debris saturated with water. They develop when water rapidly accumulates in the ground, during heavy rainfall changing the earth into a flowing river of mud. They can flow rapidly, striking with little to no warning at avalanche speeds. They also can travel serveral kilometers from their source, growing in size as they pick up trees, boulders, cars, and other materials.</p>

    <section class="disasterssection">
        <h2>Flooding</h2>
        <img src="images/flooding.jpg">
        <p id="disasterssectiondesc">Flooding is a natural event or occurence where a piece of land or area that is usually dry, suddenly gets submerged under water. Some floods can occur suddenly and recede quickly. Others take days or even months to build and discharge.</p>
        <p id="disasterssectiondesc">When floods happen in an area where people live, the water carries along objects like houses, bridges, cars, furniture, and even people. Floods occur at irregular intervals and vary in size, duration, and the affected area.</p>
